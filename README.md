# Deadlock-Detection-in-Resource-Allocation
This project implements a deadlock detection algorithm for a system with N processes, M resources, and multiple instances of each resource. The deadlock detection is based on input matrices from CSV files representing the allocation matrix, request matrix, and available vector.
